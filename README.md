Experimental chess engine for learning and fun

- Needs a recent C99 compiler to build ( tested GCC, ICC, PellesC )
- cmake to create a Makefile ( e.g. cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release )
- Only tested with POSIX systems, and PellesC under Windows
- Supports the XBoard protocol's basic commands enough to play a game using XBoard
